## 🛠️ Component API

### ProfilePhotoManager Component
```jsx
<ProfilePhotoManager
  currentImageUrl={user.profileImageUrl}    // Current photo URL
  userId={user.id}                         // User ID for API calls
  onImageUpdate={(newUrl, updatedUser) => {
    // Callback after successful upload/delete
    setUser(updatedUser);
  }}
  size={120}                               // Avatar size in pixels
  editable={true}                          // Enable/disable edit features
/>
```

### Props
- `currentImageUrl` (string): Current profile image URL
- `userId` (string|number): User ID for backend API calls
- `onImageUpdate` (function): Callback after successful operations
- `size` (number): Avatar size in pixels (default: 120)
- `editable` (boolean): Enable edit functionality (default: true)

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

### API Endpoints Needed

#### 1. Update Profile Image
```http

{
  "profileImageUrl": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dumsebwgb/image/upload/...",
  "cloudinaryPublicId": "profile_photos/user_123/abc123"
}
```

#### 2. Delete Profile Image
```http
DELETE /api/users/{id}/profile-image
```

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE users 
ADD COLUMN profile_image_url VARCHAR(500) NULL,
ADD COLUMN cloudinary_public_id VARCHAR(300) NULL;
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```env
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dumsebwgb
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=674861584934777
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=Atb2i7vnkA__xnSOR1zCpHVNKww
VITE_API_BASE=http://localhost:8080
```

### Cloudinary Upload Preset
